### Project Data Visualization

Visualize cancer rates (for select top cancers) in the American cities with a population higher than 700k (~20 cities) depending on certain environmental factors: coastal proximity, rainfall, sun index, elevation, average temperatures, air quality, fast food(beautiful soup web scraping), (social media awareness of cancer types), (List of Superfund sites) [aim for 20 different attributes]. 
Population statistics borrowed from:
http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/#cities

Data will be presented as US map with drop down menu selection of [Choice of Cancer]. View of the map will show the blobs of red/green intensity color depending on cancer rate. 
Clicking on the city will show summary of environmental factors specific for it, and cancer rates summary.
Separate pages to present bar/line graphs comparing data for environmental factors
